<p>Fish Bone Diagram as the diagram is resembles a skeleton of a fish.</p>
<p>fishbone Diagram is also named as Cause and Effect diagram, known as Ishikawa Diagram (on the name of the founder)</p>
<p>it is A Demonstration technique that helps trace an undesirable effect back to the root cause.</p>
<p>We need tools to prevent and solve problems; emphasis is given to the root of any problem so that problems would never occur (preventive approach) or surface again (corrective action approach).</p>
<p>Cause and effect diagram is used to facilitate team members to continue pushing back to the root causes of an effect or aproblem. Cause and effect diagram is normally combined with 5 why(s) of problem solving where we iteratively brainstorm the cause and effect relationship.</p>

<p>Cause and effect diagram is one of the tools from 7 basic quality tools, and used in “Plan Quality” and “Control Quality” as a Tool &amp; Technique.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plan Quality</p>
<p>In Plan Quality, we need to identify how effectively product will be delivered with the help of identified process improvements.</p>
<p>For instance, lessons learned from similar pastprojects are used as an input to perform planning a quality for the project. If, in case these lessons learned indicates any effect that need to be taken care of, Cause and Effect diagram could be used. The diagram identifies the root of the effect and results in the identification of process improvement activities, quality policies for the processes &amp; work products, metrics to measure performance of work products &amp; processes and help in developmentof quality checklist.</p></li>
<li><p>Control Quality</p>
<p>The basic objective of “Control Quality” is to identify the correctness of deliverables and work products are evaluated from the specifications and hence this process helps us to identify causes of poor process or product quality and provide advice to remove them. Cause and effect diagram is an important tool to explore these recommendations.</p>
<p>Cause and Effect diagram can be implied both in preventive approach when used as a tool in Plan Quality and corrective action approach when used as a tool in Control Quality.</p>
<p>When we are in a planning stage, identified effects serve an objective to be achieved and when we are in monitoring then these serve as what deviation we need to remove from the work products and processes.</p></li>

<p>After identification of the effect, we need to present it to the selected team members and other stakeholders to brainstorm the broader categories and subcategories of the causes of the effect.</p>
<section id="step-1-place-fish-head">
<h2 id="step-1-place-fish-head"><a href="#id4" class="toc-backref">3.1   step 1: place fish head</a></h2>
<p>This effect is presented in terms of problem statement as a head of the diagram to start the identification of the causes of the problem.</p>
</section>
<section id="step-2-place-the-fish-bones">
<h2 id="step-2-place-the-fish-bones"><a href="#id5" class="toc-backref">3.2   step 2: place the fish bones</a></h2>
<p>how ‘effect’ in terms of the problem statement is presented to the selected members during brainstorm session:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>find subbones on the main bone</p>
<p>5 why way will be used during brainstorm.</p>
<p>A selected group of people brainstorm the broader categories and associated sub categories by discussing continuously “Why,” the Effect, then further “Why” for broader categories and subsequently for sub categories. This is typically 5 Why analysis.</p>
<p>Effect and associated broader categories of causes are identified and put it into a Fishbone diagram. the emphasis is just to focus towards the steps of development of cause and effect diagram, specific example will be added later.</p></li>
<li><p>find sub-subbones on each subbone</p>
<p>Further subcategories are identified for the broad categories of causes.</p></li>
<li><p>repeat above 1, 2. then all bones is on the diagram</p>
<p>Normally identification of branches for the main arrow of the diagram involves a process of using 5 Why. Number 5 is empirical in nature, means five iterations of asking why is generally sufficient to get the root cause. However, questioning could be taken further to 6, 7, or higher in case more iterations are needed as per the nature of the problem.</p></li>

<li><p>fishbone diagram is an effective tool to avoid surface assumptions of problems and help us to avoid classic answers of problem like not enough time, not enough fund etc.</p>
<p>Problems are resolved in a way that it will not surface again, for example, if we find that we did not get a supply of a pre-requisite tool from a supplier due to non-submission of purchase order then we could resolve it by issuing the same. In future, this problem may surface again if we will not emphasize over including this cost in cost baseline.</p></li>
<li><p>fishbone diagram is an effective tool to improve <strong>communication</strong> within the team like a &#39;SOP&#39; :).</p></li>
